WeIRD means Web Intelligence for Rare Disease

http://bitem.hesge.ch/project/weird

The WeIRD project aims to provide the informational instruments needed to navigate, search and ultimately question the web evidence space of RD by providing access to high-quality specific contents helpful to help diagnosing RD. The system will use advanced information retrieval and text mining methods to holistically crawl, index and finally analyze all the explicit and implicit knowledge available on Rare Diseases.

This research project is supported by RCSO/ISNET a scientific program of the University of Applied Sciences Western Switzerland.

Here are listed the use cases (diagnostic queries) used for evaluate our system. They are given in computable format and are self explanatory. These data came from [Dragusin 2013] article and so also came from [Tang and Ng 2006].

* `findzebra_use_cases.csv` is the one extracted from [Dragusin 2013]
* `bmj_use_case.csv` is the one extracted from [Tang and Ng 2006]
* `findzebra_with_full_bmj_query.csv` is the combination of the two above where the BMJ original query is given instead of the 'google query'
